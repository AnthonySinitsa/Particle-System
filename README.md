# Particle-System
 
## Define Job's Purpose

- Identify the Task for Parallelization, updating positions, calculating physics

- Modify the Execute Method: Based on the identified task, need to implement the logic inside the Execute method of the MyJob struct. This is where the parallel processing happens.

## Implement Job Logic

- Example - Position Update, If updating positions, job might calculate the new position for each ball based on some logic (like simple physics simulation).

- Accessing Data, might need to pass more data into the job, like initial positions, velocities, or forces. Use NativeArray or other appropriate data types from the Unity.Collections namespace for this.

## Handling Results

- After the job completes, have updated data in NativeArray. need to apply this data to the balls in scene.

- Example: If the job calculates new positions, you would iterate over the results and update each ball's position accordingly.

## Memory Management

- Remember to dispose of any NativeArray or other unmanaged memory you allocate.

## Use Burst Compiler

- Gain additional performance benefits, the Burst Compiler by adding [BurstCompile] above job struct.

## Testing and Profiling

- Test the job system with an increasing number of elements to see how it scales.

- Use Unity's Profiler to indentify bottlenecks and optimize job.
